# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## TASK TO COMPLETE 

- Use a class based component to create a component to show the user profile (firstname, lastname, email, cell number (use the utilit func))

- using props load task data dynamically to the task list page 
 1. How data is supposed to be passed in out application
        props- (properties that are passed to component so as to make the more dynamic)
 2. Which concepts to use in order to pass data as required 
 3. How do we simply bind the data passed to the application
